# Crop-yield-prediction-using-machine-learning

This project explores using machine learning to predict crop yields in India, helping farmers maximize yields and income. By analyzing factors like temperature, rainfall, soil pH, and nutrient levels, machine learning algorithms can provide accurate predictions and recommendations on which crops to grow. Techniques like RNN, LSTM, and feedforward networks can be used to analyze data and create a precise model for crop yield prediction, ultimately supporting informed decision-making for farmers.
